What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, the .git file is added to the directory. This also means that
Git can be used with Git functions like log and commit and so it can track changes now available. Needed
to differentiate it from just a plain directory/folder. 


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The repository is the final stage, the working directory is the general folder, the staging area lets you see what changes
you have made/can make before you commit them. If you are happy you can commit them. I suppose it keeps the Git cleaner, as 
you wont have commits that people are unhappy with and then change straight after. So cleaner directory and code.
