When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I am working across different computers, so can have access to everything in the project all the time. 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So that if I am working on a project on different computers, I don't want github automatically being pulled to the local computer each time,
as I would have multiple files all over the place. It will also be beneficial sometimes to have some stuff not pushed to github, so before I want
people to see it.
